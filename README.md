1. **Image Filtering (10 points)**\
1.d What happens when you apply the following Filter combinations? 
    
    1. *First Gx, then GxT*\
    First we smooth the image in the horizontal direction by applying the single-dimensional Gaussian matrices Gx, then then we repeat the process in the vertical direction 
    Gy = Gx^T. It has the same effect of applying a two-dimensional gaussian matrix because the gaussian filter is a separable one. In computational terms, applying  
    the independent one-dimensional filter is more efficient, since the calculation can be performed in O(n) rather than O(n^2).
